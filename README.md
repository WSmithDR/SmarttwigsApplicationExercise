We have a super competitive internal ping pong league. Weâ€™ve been trying to keep score of our wins and points but we keep losing track. As programmers we decide to build a ping pong point manager that allows you and your opponent to register their name or choose a previously registered name and who will serve to start a game, in order to manage points per round.

The ping pong game will follow the 10 point system, where a player wins when he exceeds 10 points. If both players reach 10 points, the players need to win by 2 points to win. Serving switches every 2 points. 


The point management system  will allow the players to update their points per round and the point management system will also denote the server per round. The point management system will also announce the winner and update the players position on the leader board

The leaderboard should be visible at some point in the flow. Leaderboard should order leaderboard position by most wins primary

At any point the players should be able to terminate the game with no winner selected.
